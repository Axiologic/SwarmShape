Experimental web interface framework for creating complex RIA applications using Java Script 

- MVC (MVVM) with clean and simple architecture
- component oriented (yes, create reusable components with HTML!)
- client side  Pub/Sub channels (safe and sound against asynchronous weirdness in computed values/expressions from  models or in callbacks for other messages/events)
- reusable layouts (experimental)
- works with Ajax and swarms (SwarmESB) for backend
